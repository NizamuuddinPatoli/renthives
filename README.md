# renthives


This project is a clothing rental platform where users can rent clothes, lenders can offer their clothes for rent, and an admin manages the entire system. It consists of three panels:

1. Renter Panel: This panel is for users who want to rent clothes. They can browse available dresses, view details, and book the ones they like. They can also check their booking history and track their orders.

2. Lender Panel: Lenders use this panel to submit their clothes for rent. They can upload details like the dress type, size, price, and photos. Lenders can also view and manage their rented-out items.

3. Admin Panel: The admin oversees the platform, managing both renters and lenders. The admin can approve or reject dress submissions, bookings, and payments. They also have control over the systemâ€™s users and their activities.

This project combines e-commerce functionality with rental services, providing a seamless experience for both lenders and renters.
